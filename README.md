# Movie-Recommendation-Engine
My project on analyzing the movie data set,  and creating a recommendation engine using that analysis.
The csv files are what was given by the kaggle database.
The scripts folder contains all the raw python files used to do the analysis.
The html filed is my notebook, with documentation of all my work.

To begin I would suggest going through my notebook, and then playing around with the python scripts after that.
