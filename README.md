# Movie-Recommendation-Engine
My project on analyzing the movie data set,  and creating a recommendation engine using that analysis.

The scripts folder contains all the raw python files used to do the analysis. Please download the Data-set rar file and extract in the same folder as the scripts so that they can be used.

The html file is my notebook, with documentation of all my work.
To begin I would suggest going through my notebook, and then playing around with the python scripts after that.
